# MazeSolver

Uses a Bread-First Search algorithm to render shortest path from a start to end location. Edit main.cpp file to indicate two points on an image and it will draw a valid path if it exists.
The given test image is a simple black and white maze since the algorithm is dependent on pixel colors.
